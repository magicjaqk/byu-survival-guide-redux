                            There's a lot to discuss here, but I want to add a sort of preface surrounding the topic first: <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Everything written here should be taken as a guideline, not as a fixed rule. You can and should explore this space for yourself and experiment to find what works and doesn't work for you. Another thing to remember is that your self-worth <i>should not</i> come from who you are dating or how often you are dating. Very often in BYU/Provo/Utah County/Mormon culture, people unintentionally (or not) equate activity in dating culture to value as an individual or value to society. If there were only two principles I could inspire you to apply to your life after reading this, they would be 1) your dating life is <i>not</i> a valid measure of self-worth, and 2) the value of truly understanding consent and accountability. Anyway, I hope this resource is helpful, and I wish you the best of luck in creating a life you want to live.

                            Departing the Mormon-Mindset of Dating:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Dating is a difficult aspect of navigating a faith crisis at BYU in part because of the added difficulty in finding like-minded people to date, but also because of the need to examine everything you've been taught about dating and marriage within the faith to determine whether it's true or false, helpful or harmful. Reexamining all your views on dating so you can end up with a healthy social and romantic life may be a daunting task, but we can provide you with a few lines of inquiry below to help you get started. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            For many within Mormonism, a core part of one's own self-worth and identify is wrapped up with whom you date and marry. You may laugh at the idea that older single adults are a "menace to society", but the culture does perpetuate the idea and you may have internalized it somewhat. If you don't abandon this  mindset, it may become a drag on your mental health as you move forward in life. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            It's important to realize why marriage is so heavily emphasized within Mormonism. Marriage is a social construct that promotes order and cohesion within groups. Family units are also a basic aspect of societies at large and a major source of the emotions and satisfaction that we derive from life. Religions co-opt marriage and family into their structure in order to strengthen their own fundamental social structure, acquire a steady stream of new members through births, and cause adherents to identify the joys and satisfactions of dating and marriage with the religion itself. The religion needs its adherents to have incentives to remain loyal, and by co-opting natural pleasures of life so that they are identified with the religion, the religion gains powerful motivating factors for adherents to perpetuate that religious structure. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The end result of this is that the pleasurable things in life that are co-opted by religion get heavily regulated, while other good things in life that the religion has failed to co-opt become shunned and taboo. This is why dating, sex, marriage and the like are so fundamental to Mormonism's structure while things such as coffee and alcohol are taboo. Mormonism desires a monopoly on your pleasure in life, and controlling the dating lives of its members is one of the tools it uses to achieve this goal. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            What does this mean for how you were taught about dating and marriage? Simply put, it was distorted&mdash;its importance overemphasized and its structure institutionalized. You do not need to get married at any point in your life if that's something that does not appeal to you. Your self-worth comes from places other than who you date or marry. Your sole purpose in life is not to become a parent. Rather, parenthood is one of many options in life from which you can draw purpose and satisfaction. Dating itself is more fulfilling when you remove all the rules and cultural norms that Mormonism has placed on it, and instead allow it to happen as a natural aspect of your social life. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            You may be tempted to approach dating the same way you approach missionary work. Chances are you've already heard the analogies&mdash;investigators being people you date, lessons being the dates themselves, a baptism representing engagement, and so on. Missionary work isn't dating, and the skills learned as a missionary do not translate to the dating world. Missionaries are taught to be aggressive, forcing their message on people even if they resist. Dating, on the other hand, is not salesmanship and no one should be forcing anything on anyone. Taken to its extreme, missionary culture can lead to a dating scene rife with abuse or even sexual assault. Dating must be consensual, not forced. If you want to analogize dating, compare it to how you naturally make friends. Just as you don't proselytize people to be your friends, or set up rigid appointments to teach them about why they should be your friend, you shouldn't do the same thing with dating. Fortunately, most Mormons understand this, but this mindset leaks into Mormon dating culture all the same. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Understand that the way dating is portrayed in Mormon culture is harmful, that dating or marriage or parenthood isn't a required or integral part of your self-identity, and that dating should be a natural and consensual outflow of your normal means of socializing and making friends.

                            Be a Good Human:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            <b className="text-danger">The first and most important concept in dating is consent.</b> Exploring a new landscape of moral and ethical understanding can be difficult when exiting a high-demand fundamentalist system. Many people want to push against the restrictions they feel had control of them before. This is a wonderful way to redefine one's worldview, to open one's mind to previously unknown beauties in life, and to examine one's moral perspective. However, pushing against formerly prescribed moral rule-sets also has the potential to lead a person to make decisions without due consideration or proper forethought into the effects of such decisions. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            That's why it's so important to critically assess what consent means in a dating setting prior to being in a situation that requires expert execution. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b>The best way to gauge consent is to get verbal confirmation</b> (e.g. simply ask for permission to touch, kiss, hug, etc. someone else). It's also <i>very</i> important to read body language. Body language can be more difficult to interpret depending on the people involved so always get a clear, verbal confirmation before doing anything involving another person. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b className="text-danger">Lack of resistance is NOT a indication of consent. <br/>
                            I repeat, just because a person does not protest your advances, that does NOT give you permission to proceed.</b><br/>
                            <br/>
                            Another aspect of consent to consider is that it is fluid--meaning, it can be given, taken, and adjusted freely at any time and in any place. For example, a person who has given consent to a person to kiss them may begin to feel uncomfortable and adjust that consent to now only include cuddling in that interaction instead. That person may also revoke consent entirely and end the interaction. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            It's important to note that people are complicated and you should <i>never</i> expect an explanation as to why any level of consent has been determined by the other party involved. You may ask, but if a person doesn't have an answer or doesn't feel comfortable giving you an answer, the correct response is acceptance and support. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            As well, don't feel like you need to have answers for yourself. If you are in a situation that requires your consent, and suddenly you don't feel comfortable anymore, stop the interaction and retreat to where you feel comfortable again. Do not feel abnormal if you can't understand why you feel uncomfortable. If at any point you cannot supply your partner(s) (let alone supply yourself) an explanation for adjusting consent, do not feel pressured to push through your discomfort. Do what feels safe for you, and take care of yourself. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Clear, direct communication paired with understanding and empathy for all persons involved is the best strategy for successful interactions.

                        <p>
                            If you've made it all the way down here, congratulations! You are privileged to some of my dating tips within a non-orthodox social sphere at BYU. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            There's a lot of bad news, and a little good news. So buckle up. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Let's start with the bad. In order to date using dating apps exclusively non-lds people, you're going to have to put out a signal that you're not an orthodox mormon too. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            In order to do this, put things like, "Let's get coffee sometime!" or "Sunday brunch at [INSERT COFFEE SHOP HERE] is one of my favorite things!" (Please don't actually take this word for word, but you get the idea--a tiny flag for others to see your profile and know with fair certainty that you don't operate under the strict rules of the church/BYU.) <br/>
                            <br/>
                            This is bad news because I prefer to avoid creating documentable evidence of my disbelief as a student at BYU. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            <b>A WORD OF WARNING: This has the potential to lead to disciplinary action at BYU depending on what is explicitly said. It is not difficult to imagine the honor code office screenshotting known BYU students' profiles as evidence to go after students for not obeying the honor code to their satisfaction.</b> <br/>
                            <br/>
                            There's also the complication of LGBTQ+ dating at BYU. While society has rightfully grown (and in some respects is still growing) to accept and support LGBTQ+ individuals as equals, the community at BYU has not come nearly so far. There certainly are progressive mormons and even some individuals who might argue that they can support LGBTQ+ individuals and their dating lives while being conventional mormon adherents; however, regardless of the state of BYU's campus community, the real measure of safety is the general consensus of those who hold power of the students: bishops, stake presidents, etc. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The leaders of the church do not support and actively degrade LGBTQ+ individuals and their dating lives. Consequently, because <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fq_rM0u10gsnpR_ElqeOPdn-xZmwHhTm">bishops have no oversight as to who, when, or why they expel students</a>, LGBTQ+ people need to be especially careful in keeping your dating activity from BYU-related individuals. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Another word of caution: by getting involved with another person, you need to understand that <b>any sort of falling out between you has the potential to result in your ex-partner reporting to the honor code office as revenge</b>. You place a lot of trust in any individual with whom you interact in any way, but most especially sexually. Err more on the side of caution and avoid any situation you feel could lead to irreversible damage further down the line. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Finally, some good news: You really only have to worry about creating documentable evidence when using online dating apps. There are plenty of ways to network into non-BYU social circles.

                                    Attend UVU parties if you can (specifically without orthodox BYU-associated individuals whom you do not trust). Also, put out some feelers and make sure it's not a party that stereotypical, orthodox, LDS people will be inclined to attend.
