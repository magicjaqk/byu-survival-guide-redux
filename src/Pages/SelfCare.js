                    You don’t have to be broken, mentally diagnosed with anything, or incapable to go in and get some help. Their staff takes privacy very seriously at the expense of losing their licenses, so you are safe talking with any of them about your struggles and you can have the reassurance they won’t turn you in for not believing in the church, committing major sins, or even breaking the honor code. They are only required to report if you or another person is in imminent danger, and in that case they report to your family or law enforcement, not to the church. They put your health first, and while they all need temple recommends to work for BYU, they will all respect working through solutions to better health with you that disclude reading scriptures, praying, fasting, etc if you let them know those solutions are not helpful to you because you lost your faith. They are all educated enough not to recommend scientifically unfounded and harmful practices such as reparative therapy to the LGBTQ community. They are all LGBTQ friendly and non-believing friendly. For a recommendation of someone who could fit your needs well, contact <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/cbbpPK0B7QWOeYf63">BYU Guru</a>. <br/>

                    One major issue with the counseling center is getting in. They service a third of students at BYU so if you need help it may still be 3-4 weeks before they can find you an appointment. Other solutions include: <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://caps.byu.edu/silvercloud">SilverCloud</a>- an online, work at your own pace, non face to face counseling service by BYU where you receive education on how to better your health and can include an interactive journal with a counseling student if desired.</li>
                        <li>Group counseling- ask about this option at the desk.</li>
                        <li>Off Campus Counseling. LDS Family Services is generally not recommended as they tend to give advice that is even more in line with the church than the BYU counseling center. The BYU counseling office has a case worker that will work with you to recommend other counselors in the valley that may be especially suited to your needs, including a faith crisis.</li>

                        Avoid situations around campus where you are easily triggered. This may include not attending campus devotional, not attending FHE groups, missing General Conference or Ward and Stake conferences, only attending on Sundays when you need to and/or can bear to go, etc. <br/>

                        Regular exercise is proven to outperform medication in increasing wellbeing and happiness. There are great resources on campus to provide a wide variety of exercise experiences that meet your interests and needs. Consider:

                        Eating healthy foods, while not as cheap and not as easy to eat or prepare, can also significantly increase your general feeling of health and wellbeing. Fruits, vegetables, and good proteins will always help you feel much better than ramen noodles, Little Ceasars pizzas, and cold sugar cereals, even if those are the easiest “college foods”. Consider:

                            <li>Packing fresh fruits and vegetables in your backpack with a yummy dip- ranch, hummus, peanut butter, or yogurt</li>

                            <li>Making large portions of healthy foods you make so you can have leftovers</li>
                            <li>Choosing healthier choices on campus restaurants</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        Find a support system of good friends that accept you and love you. Research shows that even just having 2-3 close friends significantly increases life satisfsetSub. Consider:

                            </li>
                            <li>Consider joining a non-BYU community that more closely aligns with your adjusting faith, including:
                                <ul>

                        <br/>
                        Find ways to make a difference in the world, as this will help you find meaning in your life if your faith is not providing you with adequate meaning. This may include using your education in professional ways that benefits the world, becoming involved in research on campus, or engaging in service opportunities that fit your abilities, interests, and schedule.
